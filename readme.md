# WHY ? 
This godot project is just there , to act as a reference to solving various game development problems , 
encountered day to day while making FPS character controllers .

# FEATURES OF THE FPS CHARACTER CONTROLLER
         1. Simple controls for a kinematic character using WASD.
         2. Simple Weapon attached to it (pistol).
         3. Pistol has Projectile mechanism , and not Raycast mechanism.
         4. Bullets leave a bullet hole on the surface they collide , if the surface is marked as **shootable**.
         5. Bullets have a raycast to their forward direction , hence they know where they should land before it really happens: 
                  this mechanism helps to create the bullet holes and implement other cache stuff.
         
 
# FUTURE FEATURES OF THE FPS CHARACTER CONTROLLER 
         1. Slope / Stair climbing mechanism [its a _pain in the b10t_ for me to implement it well]
         2.
